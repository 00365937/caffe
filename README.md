**This is an experimental, Microsoft-led branch by Pavle Josipovic (@pavlejosipovic). It is a work-in-progress.**

This branch of Caffe ports the framework to Windows.

(https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pavlejosipovic/caffe-v45qi) AppVeyor (Windows build)

## Windows Setup
**Requirements**: Visual Studio 2013

### Pre-Build Steps
Copy `.\windows\CommonSettings.props.example` to `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`

By defaults Windows build requires `CUDA` and `cuDNN` libraries.
Both can be disabled by adjusting build variables in `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`.
Python support is disabled by default, but can be enabled via `.\windows\CommonSettings.props` as well.
3rd party dependencies required by Caffe are automatically resolved via NuGet.

### CUDA
Download `CUDA Toolkit 7.5` [from nVidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
If you don't have CUDA installed, you can experiment with CPU_ONLY build.
In `.\windows\CommonSettings.props` set `CpuOnlyBuild` to `true` and set `UseCuDNN` to `false`.

### cuDNN
Download `cuDNN v3` or `cuDNN v4` [from nVidia website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).  
Unpack downloaded zip to `CuDnnPath` defined in `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`.  
Alternatively, you can disable cuDNN by setting `UseCuDNN` to `false` in the property file.  

### Python
To build Caffe Python wrapper set `PythonSupport` to `true` in `.\windows\CommonSettings.props`.
Download Miniconda 2.7 64-bit Windows installer [from Miniconda website] (http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).
Install for all users and add Python to PATH (through installer).

Run the following commands from elevated command prompt:

```
conda install --yes numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-image pip
pip install protobuf
```

### Build
Now, you should be able to build `.\windows\Caffe.sln`
